    <h4>
        <strong>...the person behind I Run Errands</strong>:
    </h4>
    <p>Welcome</p>
    <p><strong>I Run Errands</strong> started because for more than 15 years of working in a 9-6 job, I found extremely frustrating that I needed to take days off from my annual leave to sit around waiting for deliveries or repair workers.</p>
    <p>Being a person who likes to travel and enjoy the weekends outside home; my to-do list was getting longer and longer. I was also so tired.</p>
    <p>So I thought:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "There must be an easier way and there must be lots of people out there just like me."
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>I Run Errands</strong></em> was born.</p>
    <p>
        My goal is to offer you a trustworthy and exceptional service helping you with that never ending to-do list to give you more time in your day. I want to reduce the stress and make your day easier so that you can enjoy more time with your family and appreciate the simple pleasures that life has to offer.
    </p>
